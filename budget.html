          <p>We will be using 18 gallon storage bins that will be about $13/ea. We are also going to use 50 gallon Recycling Cans that are about 120$/ea. We will have 1 recycling bin at each building and 2 recycling cans at the main building where the recycled "trash" will then be deposited for the trash trucks to pick up. So our overall budget will be $300. </p>

        <content>
          <p>Our thoughts on fundraising were that we were going to sell ice cream at concessions or becuase it is currently cold outside, we could sell hot chocolate. For the ice cream, it is about $6 for a pack of 12. We'd then sell the ice cream for $1, so if we were to sell a whole pack, we would be making $6 in profit per pack. For hot chocolate, on the other hand, there is a 30ct of mix in a $4 box. We'll sell one cup of hot chocolate for a dollar and for a 1gal milk jug to mix with the HC mix, it is $4 as well so the profit with one box of hot chocolate is around $22. </p>
